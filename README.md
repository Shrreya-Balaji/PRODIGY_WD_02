# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
